    "# Welcome to SWIRRL!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SWIRRL is webservice API that allows Science Gateways to easily integrate analysis tools in their websites. By combining storage and tools, such as ***Workflows**, **Jupyter notebooks** and **GitHub** repositories, SWIRRL creates dedicated and reproducible working environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The /data folder\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the API's support for workflow and data-staging, SWIRRL workspaces are populated for you with data of interest,  collected from external data providers. If you are reading this page, it is likely that you have already requsted a web site to collect and provide you with a set of data in this notebook! \n",
    "\n",
    "SWIRRL manages all the data staged to the workspace in the ***/data*** folder. To make sure that your workspace is always consistent and your analysis reproducible, this is a 'read only' folder. However, you can always request to the web site to add more data for you here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### /data/latest\n",
    "\n",
    "***Is the data already staged to this workspace?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Go check your ***/data/latest*** folder! Here you will always find the most updated version the data that is available for you to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not there yet? Click on the SWIRRL Explorer ![enter image description here](https://assets.gitlab-static.net/uploads/-/system/project/avatar/17988184/Screenshot_2020-04-09_at_10.37.38.png?width=32)\n",

    "This useful extension will tell you whether the workflow copying the data is still running.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### /data/staginghistory\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time data is staged to your workspace, SWIRRL keeps track of the changes by maintaining a staging history. You will find this in the ***/data/staginghistory*** folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/staginghistory.png\" alt=\"wfjob\" style=\"height:260px;width:500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the ***stage.nnnn*** folders will preserve the state of your storage before the next staging workflow has been invoked. This will give you the opportuinity to always access previous version of the data. For instance, to reproduce analysis preformed on older versions fo the data and make comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "***How to know whether a file has been updated?***\n",
    "\n",
    "Files are available throughout the different stages, incrementally. Each ***stage.nnnn*** folder contains a ***swirrl_fileinfo.json***. Here you will find a complete record of metadata describing ***filename***, ***state***, ***id*** and ***sourceUrl*** of every of the file in your storage at a the given stage. The ***state** property can tell you whether the file is ***updated***, new, or unchanged.\n",

    "## The SWIRRL Explorer\n",
    "\n",
    "SWIRRL in combination with JupyterLab, allows you to customise your workspace, share and reproduce the progress of your analysis. You can update and install new python libraries in your environtment or restore it a previous state. You can freeze and create snapshot of your notebook directly to your Github account or to a repository managed by your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can control these actions via the SWIRRL Explorer. They will be logged and repurposed to you interactively. As shown in the the screenshot below, the list also inlcudes the workflows exectuted by the SWIRRL API, with a link to its detailed documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/activities.png\" alt=\"activities\" style=\"height:400px;width:400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update and Restore Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SWIRRL and Jupyter allow the installation and update of additional python libraries in a workspace. This can be performed via the API or directly from the users via the Jupyter terminal. The image above shows that the ***Update Library*** activty also displays a summary of the installation performed, \"*pip -install prov*\". \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it may happen that changes to your environment could make it unstable or not suitable for your purposes. By clicking on the ***Restore*** button displayed close to a ***Create***, ***Update Libraries*** activities, users can recover from these situation by restoring the environment to a previous state. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SWIRRL will always show the *diff* between the current environment and the one to be resotred. Upon confirmation, the curred workspace will replaced. The image below shows an example of the *diff* message shown to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/restore.png\" alt=\"restore\" style=\"height:270px;width:400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** ***Restore*** activities are also logged, and SWIRRL allows you to recover to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "One  of  the  benefits  of  using  Jupyter  is  that  the  analysis methods can be documented in the notebook and shared  among  peers who should be then able to execute them.  However, to  make  sure  that the  method  are reproducible,  the  software environment and the source data needed for the analysis require to be somehow recorded and managed. This is typically currently on the responsibility of the author of the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "SWIRRL aims at reducing the burden on the user by offering a service that automatically generates a reproducible snapshot of the current state of the notebook and its environment, including the reference. Following a sim-ilar approach of systems such asEverware[7], SWIRRL storesits snapshots to a Git repository. However, SWIRRL brings thisfunctionality  one  step  forward  by  supporting  interoperabilitywithBinder5.  This  will  allow  user  to  restore  their  snapshotswithin  the  SWIRRL  context,  thereby  taking  advantage  of  allthe  other  services,  as  well  as  sharing  them  with  other  peersby  providing  the  link  to  the  snapshot’s  repository.  They  canthen  restore  the  working  environment  within  public  or  self-managed  deployments  ofMyBinder,  according  to  the  quotasand possibilities in terms of storage, computational resourcesand connectivity.Ultimately, SWIRRL makes sure that the different types ofinformation leading to the reproducibility of a certain stage ofthe  research  progress  are  extracted,  formatted  and  their  rolesdescribed according to a specific provenance template. Then,the collection of resources is packaged and version controlledwithin  aGitrepository.  This  is  automatically  created  fora  particular  notebook  instance.  Below  a  description  of  itscontent.1)  Notebook  Environment:A  notebook  snapshot  includesthe details about its running environment. This consists of theimage  of  the  container  and  the  list  of  required  libraries.  Theprovenance  records  related  to  the  specific  notebook  servicewill  provide  these  information.  These  will  be  converted  toDocker6andConda7files, respectively for system and depen-dency management. These are added to the repository2)  Analysis  Artifacts:These  consists  of  all  the  contentstored  within  the  SWIRRL  session’sWork  Volume,  which  ismounted  to  the  notebook.  This  may  include  notebook  pages,scripts, software modules and even data such as intermediateresults  or  files  explicitly  uploaded  by  the  users.  To  preventlarge output data files to be sent to the Git repository, whichwould  be  very  inefficient,  the  files  to  be  added  are  filtered\n",
    "Repositories are created for you in the form ***Binders***. These can be thereby shared with other users who can redeploy them obtaining a consistent copy of your workspace, wich include libraries, no\n",
